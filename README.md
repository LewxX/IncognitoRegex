# IncognitoRegex

This extension allows you to configure Regular Expressions for websites that you want to always open in Incognito mode.

For example, if you always want to open your banking page in Incognito mode, you can use a regex like: .*(bank|banking).*

You can experiment with regex at: https://regexr.com/8ab88
