# IncognitoRegex

unfortunately I lost the original source code,   
this is the code from current deployed verison in the chrome Web store

## How To Start Developing

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started

- goto Chrome/Edge/Brave Extensions page
- enable Developer mode
- click "load unpacked" to load local folder as chrome extension
- disable extension from app store (otherwise you have it twice)
- play arround
- click reload icon on dev extension


### TODOs
- this needs to be ported to "manifest_version": 3
    - https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/migrate
- also it may need some hierarchy stucture (e.g. images in a seperate folder)
- this readme should be extended
